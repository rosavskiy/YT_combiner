Russian President Vladimir Putin called it a “special military operation,” but the scale of the attack shows this is a full-scale war that has already caused more than 100 casualties and forced more than half a million Ukrainians to flee their homes.\n\nUkraine and Russia’s conflict goes back to 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces took over parts of southeastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. But to understand the full context behind the invasion, it’s important to go even farther back, to the time when Europe’s current-day divisions began, and see how that shaped Europe’s power balance today. \n\nTo understand the current conflict’s history in less than 10 minutes, watch the video above. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nFor the latest on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, read more from Vox: https://bit.ly/3hBNll2\n\nOr listen to our podcasts that cover the history of the situation, pull in expert voices, and more: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0QVMmiEXj4S5NTz6Ze6N6Y?si=fbbeecfc70e14b8f&nd=1 \n\nFor more information on the human impact this war is having on the ground, check out Human Rights Watch:\nhttps://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/ukraine\n\nFor the UN’s latest information on the displacement of Ukrainians click here:\nhttps://news.un.org/en/story/2022/02/1112872\n\nFor the latest on the situation on the ground you can check out the daily updates from the Institute for the Study of War:\nhttps://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-conflict-update-9\n\nAnd the International Crisis Group:\nhttps://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine\n\nFor a detailed look at Ukraine’s decision to pull out from the 2013 EU agreement, check this out:\nhttps://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2013-11-27/ukraine-withdraws-signing-association-agreement-vilnius-motives-and\n\nTo better understand the annexation of Crimea and what that meant for Ukraine, click here:\nhttps://carnegieendowment.org/2014/03/13/use-of-russia-s-military-in-crimean-crisis-pub-54949\n\nTo understand Putin’s grip on power, we recommend this book:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Putin-v-People-Perilous-Politics/dp/0300238398\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
